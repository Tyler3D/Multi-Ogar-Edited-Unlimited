; [NOTES]
; MultiOgar uses cell size instead of cell mass to improve performance!
; In order to get the cell size from mass value, you need to calculate using this formula:
;     size = SQRT( mass * 100 )
;
; For example, to set start mass = 43:
;     size = SQRT( 43 * 100 ) = SQRT( 4300 ) = 65.57
; Set playerStartSize = 66
;
; Also, you can use the following syntax to specify mass:
;     playerStartSize = massToSize(43)
; It will be automatically converted to 66
